\begin{category}{Work \\experience}

\citem{Independent Software Developer}, Ottawa, Canada (03/2019 -- 12/2019 )
\begin{itemize}
  \item (09/2019 -- 12/2020) Automated the stress testing of aquisitions
   models to analyize optimal life spans for given project. As part of the project 
    I created a reuable model which can be repopulated with new data and generate predictions and visualizations.
  \item (03/2019 -- 05/2019) Developed a data visualization tool in Python that allowed
    porotfilio managers to easily display projections of clients incomes to better understand risk
    inherent in investment options as well as potential returns given various scenarios.
\end{itemize}

\citem{Data Scientist (Full Time, Intern)}, Statistics Canada (04/2019 -- 01/2020)\\
Managed and developed a project to forecast commodity yields using Python and R. Collected data
from various sources, assembled database and preprocessed the data. Developed a pipeline to 
split the data in batches to apply various machine learning techniques to predict yields for a given
season.

\citem{Co-Founder and VP of Internal Affairs}, Quantitative Finance Association (UOttawa) (07/2018 -- 04/2019)\\
Co-founded the QFA as an initiative to bring together students from the business, engineering
 and mathematics departments to apply technology for solving business problems. For example,
 the first even I hosted had over 70 students participating. Together, we built an algorithm to 
 parse twitter data, conduct sentiment analysis and make trades using the Interactive Brokers Api.

\citem{VP of Logistics}, Management Information Systems and Analytics Association (UOttawa) (05/2015 -- 09/2015)\\
Joined the smallest club on campus with the goal of growing the club to become one of the biggest.
To do I helped to organize several meet and greets as well as speaker series which helped introduce
students to professionals from industry to learn about their career paths. Our initiative was 
very successful as we grew to be one of the most known clubs in the business school.

\citem{Undergraduate Research Assistant}, University Of Ottawa (09/2016 -- 02/2017)\\
The goal of this research was to determine if there exists a relationship between
the amount of money left on the table during the IPO process and the prevailing sentiment
toward a company prior to IPO. By collecting data from various databases including the SDC and 
bloomberg datases, as well as applying data analysis techniques. 

\end{category}

% ----- Projects --------------------------------------------

\begin{category}{Projects}
\citem{Epidemiology Simulations}, Personal/Open Source (2020)\\
  Created a project to simulate the spread of an infectious disease as an alternative to traditional
  differential equation based models. By using a drawn map as well as underlying population distributions
  and simulating the lives of "people" as they go about their day. Introducing an index patient and
  recording infections through time as well as introducing restrictions on movements to see the effects.
\citem {Real-Estate Price Prediction}, Personal/Open Source (2019)\\
  I took on this project in an effort to learn how to use graph databases. By scraping data about
  house prices and their properties, as well as all of the city features (such as school and businesses)
  and attempted to determine from where houses derived their valuations.
\citem {Discount Cash Flow Analysis}, Automated Final Year Project (2019)\\
  Rather than use the traditional spread sheets, I used python and the bloomberg API to create a 
  program which can generate a discount cashflow analysis for any company listed on the market. 
  This generalized approach allows for the creation of models with all historical data embedded and 
  for the analyst to simply apply their opinion in which assumptions are more relevant.
